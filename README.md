# Spotify To Discord

Gameplan on how this bot will work:
1) User inputs their spotify playlist ID
2) The bot uses the spotify API to get all of the song names from the playlist
3) The Youtube API is then used to create a private playlist
4) Each of the songs are searched on youtube and added to the playlist
5) An in-house music streaming bot will then play the music
